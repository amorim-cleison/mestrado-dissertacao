\subsection{Desafios da área}
\label{sec:slr-desafios}

Embora possamos constatar avanços recentes e um aumento do interesse pela área de \acrshort{slr}, sobretudo nos últimos anos, ainda há desafios importantes que precisam ser resolvidos para conduzir a progressos mais expressivos. 
Nesta seção, discutiremos brevemente alguns desses desafios.

% \cite{cooper-2011-slr}
% Although SLR and speech recognition are drastically different in many respects, they both suffer from similar issues; co-articulation between signs means that a sign will be modified by those either side of it. 
% Inter-signer differences are large; every signer has their own style, in the same way that everyone has their own accent or handwriting. Also similar to handwriting, signers can be either left hand or right hand dominant. For a left handed signer, most signs will be mirrored, but time line specific ones will be kept consistent with the cultural ‘left to right’ axis. While it is not obvious how best to include these higher level linguistic constructs of the language, it is obviously essential if true, continuous SLR is to become reality.


\subsubsection{Abordagem inadequada}
\label{sec:slr-desafios-abordagem-inadequada}

\citeonline{bragg-2019-slr-interdisciplinary} afirma que pesquisas envolvendo línguas de sinais comumente ocorrem em silos disciplinares e, como resultado, não tratam o problema de uma forma abrangente.
Por exemplo, há muitas publicações que apresentam algoritmos de detecção ou reconhecimento de sinais, mas poucas realizam a tradução para uma outra língua; ou ainda, várias pesquisas limitam-se a rotular imagens de mãos paradas na configuração de uma letra ou número isolados, mas não observam o contexto real em volta delas ou o que aquilo significa perante a linguística. 

Segundo \citeonline{cooper-2011-slr}, notam-se também trabalhos abordando o problema como sendo um reconhecimento de gestos, onde busca-se identificar parâmetros e métodos para rotular os sinais dentro de um conjunto de possibilidades. No entanto, as línguas de sinais vão muito mais além do que uma coleção de gestos bem especificados.

Além disso, por conta da complexidade maior que representa reconhecer sinais contínuos, percebe-se que há uma preferência nesses estudos por reconhecer sinais isolados, bem como uma oferta maior de \textit{datasets} com sinais isolados. Essa complexidade se dá principalmente porque, na língua de sinais, a transição entre os sinais não é claramente demarcada, uma vez que as mãos estarão sempre se movendo para a posição inicial do próximo sinal. Isso é conhecido como epêntese de movimento ou co-articulação -- termos emprestados da terminologia da fala.
Contudo, \citeonline{cooper-2011-slr} ressaltam que quando consideramos sistemas de reconhecimento de línguas de sinais que sejam aplicáveis ao mundo real, há uma demanda por enfatizar os sinais contínuos ou ao menos desenvolver técnicas que possam ser evoluídas para utilização nesse contexto.

Por fim, \citeonline{bragg-2019-slr-interdisciplinary} adicionam que muitas equipes desenvolvendo algoritmos de reconhecimento de sinais carecem de membros Surdos, do conhecimento das complexidades linguísticas que seus algoritmos deveriam levar em conta, ou de uma empatia com os problemas reais que essa tecnologia poderia ou deveria resolver. 
Muito frequentemente, algoritmos de \acrshort{slr} são treinados em \textit{datasets} que não refletem casos de uso reais -- como é o caso do reconhecimento de mãos estáticas e isoladas sem o devido contexto. Isso resulta em abordagens que têm um valor bastante limitado no mundo real.


% Call 1: Involve Deaf team members throughout.
% Deaf involvement and leadership are crucial for designing systems that are useful to users, respecting Deaf ownership of sign languages, and securing adoption.

% Call 2: Focus on real-world applications.
% Sign language processing is appropriate for specifc domains, and the technology has limitations. Datasets, algorithms, interfaces, and overall systems should be built to serve real-world use cases, and account for real-world constraints.





\subsubsection{Natureza visual}
\label{sec:slr-desafios-natureza-visual}

As línguas de sinais são visuais e apresentam o desafio de serem multicanais, ou seja, o significado é transmitido através de vários modos ao mesmo tempo \cite{cooper-2011-slr}. Por exemplo, a informação é articulada através de ambas mãos, mas também pela relação delas com o corpo do articulador e com o espaço à frente dele; além disso, também fazem parte as expressões não-manuais que ocorrem simultaneamente, as quais podem modificar o sentido do discurso; todos esses canais compõem a mensagem sendo transmitida e precisam ser levados em consideração.

\citeonline{bragg-2019-slr-interdisciplinary} comentam que um dos principais desafios enfrentados na modelagem e processamento das línguas de sinais é a impossibilidade de aplicar métodos poderosos que já são utilizados por línguas faladas ou escritas devido às diferenças estruturais que elas apresentam. Devido a isso, a aplicação direta de métodos de \acrshort{mt} e de \acrshort{nlp} deixaria de capturar aspectos importantes dos sinais ou simplesmente não funcionaria. Isso porque muitos desses métodos assumem a existência de uma única palavra executada por vez ou que o contexto não altera a palavra sendo pronunciada, o que não é o caso das línguas de sinais: estas adotam múltiplos canais simultâneos e sua interpretação depende diretamente da forma como o conteúdo é organizado no contexto espacial. 

Além disso, técnicas de \acrshort{mt} e \acrshort{nlp} geralmente utilizam algum tipo de anotação (geralmente no formato de texto) como informação de entrada. No entanto, as línguas de sinais não possuem uma forma escrita ou anotação padrão e, por conta disso, não há dados anotados confiáveis e em larga escala para alimentar essas técnicas. 
Ainda que pesquisadores optassem por selecionar um sistema de anotação em particular para descrever os sinais, este seria um processo demorado e suscetível a erros. Isso também demandaria um treinamento extensivo para que esses indivíduos alcançassem proficiência na língua de sinais e no sistema de anotação escolhido, o que seria caro e restringiria o número de pessoas que seriam capazes de contribuir com essa tarefa. Como resultado, torna-se difícil combinar \textit{datasets} distintos para aumentar o poder dos algoritmos desenvolvidos ou possibilitar que eles aprendam a partir de conteúdos gerados naturalmente \cite{bragg-2019-slr-interdisciplinary}.

Finalmente, \citeonline{cooper-2011-slr} ressaltam a pouca atenção que parâmetros não-manuais têm recebido pela literatura em \acrshort{slr}. De acordo com os autores, grande parte da informação de um sinal é transmitida através desse canal e, particularmente, há sinais que são idênticos quando aos parâmetros manuais e distinguem-se apenas por meio dos traços não-manuais -- conforme discutimos nas seções anteriores. Isso enfatiza a relevância que esses parâmetros representam no contexto do reconhecimento de sinais.

% Call 5: Standardize the annotation system and develop software for annotation support.
% Annotations are essential to training recognition systems, providing inputs to NLP and MT software, and generating signing avatars. Standardization would support data sharing, expand software compatibility, and help control quality. Annotation support would help improve accuracy, reliability, and cost.





\subsubsection{Linguística particular}
\label{sec:slr-desafios-linguistica-particular}

Conforme discutimos ao longo das seções anteriores, as línguas de sinais possuem uma linguística única com inúmeras particularidades oriundas de sua natureza visual. Devido a isso, há uma demanda de que as pesquisas em \acrshort{slr} desenvolvam técnicas que abordem adequadamente essa linguística, ao invés de replicar aquelas utilizadas no reconhecimento de línguas faladas e escritas, para assim conduzir a avanços mais consistentes da área.

\citeonline{bragg-2019-slr-interdisciplinary} afirmam que compreender a representação dessa língua requer, no entanto, exposição à cultura Surda e à sua linguística, que é algo que as comunidades que impulsionam o progresso da área visão computacional geralmente não possuem. Sendo assim, este parece ser o primeiro desafio a ser superado aqui.



\subsubsection{\textit{Datasets} limitados}
\label{sec:slr-desafios-datasets-limitados}

De acordo com \citeonline{cooper-2011-slr} e \citeonline{bragg-2019-slr-interdisciplinary}, os conjuntos de dados disponíveis publicamente para línguas de sinais são limitados em quantidade e qualidade, e essas deficiências limitam o poder e a capacidade de generalização de algoritmos dos aprendizagem de máquina, tornando-os inadequados para abordar os desafios apresentados pelo \acrshort{slr}. 

\textit{Datasets} maiores e mais diversos são essenciais para treinar modelos generalizáveis. Além disso, as técnicas de aprendizagem de máquina modernas e orientadas a dados (como a aprendizagem profunda) funcionam melhor em cenários ricos em dados. Por exemplo, o sucesso em áreas como o reconhecimento da fala foi possível graças ao treinamento utilizando corpus contendo milhões de palavras; apesar disso, os \textit{datasets} de reconhecimento de sinais são várias ordens de magnitude menores, normalmente contendo menos de 100.000 sinais.

Outro problema destacado por \citeonline{bragg-2019-slr-interdisciplinary} corresponde à baixa diversidade de usuários representada nesses \textit{datasets}, que ocorre devido ao seu tamanho geralmente reduzido e pela dependência excessiva de conteúdo produzido por intérpretes ou consultores. Para refletir com precisão essa população e cenários mais realistas, é necessário abranger uma variedade maior de gênero, idade, roupas, geografia, cultura, tom de pele, proporções corporais, deficiências, fluência, cenário de fundo, condições de iluminação, qualidade e ângulos de câmera, entre outros. Também é importante expandir a diversidade de línguas de sinais abrangidas por esses \textit{datasets}.

Além disso, muitos desses \textit{datasets} permitem que usuários não-nativos da língua de sinais (como, por exemplo, pessoas inexperientes ou estudantes da língua) contribuam para eles. Em outros casos, também incluem amostras recortadas de fontes online (como, por exemplo, YouTube) cuja procedência e nível de habilidade dos usuários são desconhecidos. Isso gera uma representação incorreta do contexto real de uso pelo grupo principal de usuários, o que é necessário para a construção de modelos mais efetivos com essa finalidade.

Por fim, ampliar a disponibilidade de \textit{datasets} com sinais contínuos é um passo relevante, uma vez que a maioria dos casos de uso do mundo real das línguas de sinais envolve conversação natural com frases completas e enunciados mais longos \cite{bragg-2019-slr-interdisciplinary}.





% Call 4: Create larger, more representative, public video datasets.
% Large datasets with diverse signers are essential for training software to perform well for diverse users. Public availability is important for spurring developments, and for ensuring that the Deaf community has equal ownership.

% abordagem inadequada
%     disciplinary silos (recognizing x translating)
%     continuous sign recognition

% \cite{bragg-2019-slr-interdisciplinary}
% Current research in sign language processing occurs in disciplinary silos, and as a result does not address the problem comprehensively. For example, there are many computer science publications presenting algorithms for recognizing (and less frequently translating) signed content. 

% \cite{cooper-2011-slr}
% Many approaches to SLR incorrectly treat the problem as Gesture Recognition (GR). So research has thus far focused on identifying optimal features and classification methods to correctly label a given sign from a set of possible signs. However, sign language is far more than just a collection of well specified gestures.

% 5.1 Continuous Sign Recognition
% The majority of work on SLR has been focused on recognising isolated instances of signs, this is not applicable to a real world sign language recognition system. The task of recognising continuous sign language is complicated primarily by the problem that in natural sign language, the transition between signs is not clearly marked because the hands will be moving to the starting position of the next sign. This is referred to as the movement epenthesis or co-articulation (which borrows from speech terminology).
% [...]

% \cite{bragg-2019-slr-interdisciplinary}
% The teams creating these algorithms often lack Deaf members with lived experience of the problems the technology could or should solve, and lack knowledge of the linguistic complexities of the language for which their algorithms must account. The algorithms are also often trained on datasets that do not reflect real-world use cases. As a result, such single-disciplinary approaches to sign language processing have limited real-world value [39].

% \cite{bragg-2019-slr-interdisciplinary}
% Modeling & Natural Language Processing
% The main challenge facing modeling and NLP is the inability to apply powerful methods used for spoken/written languages due to language structure differences and lack of annotations.
% - Structural Complexity: Many MT (machine translation) and NLP methods were developed for spoken/written languages. However, sign languages have a number of structural differences from these languages. These differences mean that straightforward application of MT and NLP methods will fail to capture some aspects of sign languages or simply not work. In particular, many methods assume that one word or concept is executed at a time. However, many sign languages are multi-channel, for instance conveying an object and its description simultaneously. Many methods also assume that context does not change the word being uttered; however, in sign languages, content can be spatially organized and interpretation directly dependent on that spatial context.
% - Annotations: Lack of reliable, large-scale annotations are a barrier to applying powerful MT and NLP methods to sign languages. These methods typically take annotations as input, commonly text. Because sign languages do not have a standard written form or a standard annotation form, we do not have large-scale annotations to feed these methods. Lack of large-scale annotated data is similarly a problem for training recognition systems, as described in the previous section.


% \cite{bragg-2019-slr-interdisciplinary}
% Recognition & Computer Vision
% Despite the large improvements in recent years, there are still many important and unsolved recognition problems, which hinder real-world applicability.
% - Depiction: Depiction refers to visually representing or enacting content in sign languages (see Background & Related Work), and poses unique challenges for recognition and translation. Understanding depiction requires exposure to Deaf culture and linguistics, which the communities driving progress in computer vision generally lack. Sign recognition algorithms are often based on speech recognition, which does not handle depictions (which are uncommon and unimportant in speech). As a result, current techniques cannot handle depictions. It is also difficult to create depiction annotations. Countless depictions can express the same concept, and annotation systems do not have a standard way to encode this richness.
% - Annotations: Producing sign language annotations, the machine-readable inputs needed for supervised training of AI models, is time consuming and error prone. There is no standardized annotation system or level of annotation granularity. As a result, researchers are prevented from combining annotated datasets to increase power, and must handle low inter-annotator agreement. Annotators must also be trained extensively to reach sufficient proficiency in the desired annotation system. Training is expensive, and constrains the set of people who can provide annotations beyond the already restricted set of fluent signers. The lack of a standard written form also prevents learning from naturally generated text – e.g., NLP methods that expect text input, using parallel text corpora to learn corresponding grammar and vocabulary, and more generally leveraging ubiquitous text resources.

% 5.3 Fusing Multi-Modal Sign Data
% From the review of SLR by Ong and Ranganath [82], one of their main observations is the lack of attention that non-manual features has received in the literature. This is still the case several years on. Much of the information in a sign is conveyed through this channel, and particularly there are signs that are identical in respect of the manual features and only distinguishable by the non-manual features accompanying the sign. The difficulty is identifying exactly which elements are important to the sign, and which elements are coincidental. For example, does the blink of the signer convey information valuable to the sign, or was the signer simply blinking?
% This problem of identifying the parts of the sign that contains information relevant to the understanding of the sign makes SLR a complex problem to solve.

% Datasets
% Public sign language datasets have shortcomings that limit the power and generalizability of systems trained on them.
% - Size: Modern, data-driven machine learning techniques work best in data-rich scenarios. Success in speech recognition, which in many ways is analogous to sign recognition, has been made possible by training on corpora containing millions of words. In contrast, sign language corpora, which are needed to fuel the development of sign language recognition, are several orders of magnitude smaller, typically containing fewer than 100,000 articulated signs. (See Table 2 for a comparison between speech and sign language datasets.)
% - Continuous Signing: Many existing sign language datasets contain individual signs. Isolated sign training data may be important for certain scenarios (i.e., creating a sign language dictionary), but most real-world use cases of sign language processing involve natural conversational with complete sentences and longer utterances.
% - Native Signers: Many datasets allow novices (i.e., students) to contribute, or contain data scraped from online sources (e.g., YouTube [62]) where signer provenance and skill is unknown. Professional interpreters, who are highly skilled but are often not native signers, are also used in many datasets (e.g., [42]). The act of interpreting also changes the execution (e.g., by simplifying the style and vocabulary, or signing slower for understandability). Datasets of native signers are needed to build models that refect this core user group.
% - Signer Variety: The small size of current signing datasets and over-reliance on content from interpreters mean that current datasets typically lack signer variety. To accurately refect the signing population and realistic recognition scenarios, datasets should include signers that vary by: gender, age, clothing, geography, culture, skin tone, body proportions, disability, fuency, background scenery, lighting conditions, camera quality, and camera angles. It is also crucial to have signer-independent datasets, which allow people to assess generalizability by training and testing on different signers. Datasets must also be generated for different sign languages (i.e., in addition to ASL).
